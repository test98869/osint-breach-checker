# 🔍 OSINT Breach Checker

A modern, ethical security research tool that checks if an email has been compromised in data breaches and whether associated passwords have been exposed. Features both a CLI and a sleek dark-themed web interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Email Breach Check** - Search across multiple breach databases (IntelX, LeakCheck)
- 🛡️ **Password Exposure Check** - Uses HIBP Pwned Passwords API with k-anonymity
- 📊 **Risk Assessment** - Color-coded risk levels with actionable recommendations
- 🌐 **Web Interface** - Beautiful dark-themed UI built with Flask
- 💻 **CLI Tool** - Command-line interface for quick checks
- 🔒 **Privacy-Focused** - Passwords hashed locally, never sent in full
- 📝 **No Data Storage** - Nothing is logged or stored
- 🆓 **Free to Use** - No API keys required

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osint-breach-checker.git
cd osint-breach-checker

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Web Interface

```bash
# Easy way
./run.sh

# Or manually
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

### CLI Tool

```bash
python breach_checker.py
```

The tool will prompt you for:
1. **Email address** to check
2. **Password** to verify (entered securely, not displayed)

## How It Works

### Email Breach Check
- Queries Have I Been Pwned API v3
- Returns list of breaches where email appears
- Shows breach dates and compromised data types

### Password Check (k-Anonymity)
- Hashes password locally using SHA-1
- Sends only first 5 characters of hash to API
- Receives ~500 hash suffixes back
- Matches locally without exposing full password
- Returns how many times password appears in breaches

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK**: Email breached AND password compromised → Change immediately
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Either email or password compromised → Change recommended
- **LOW RISK**: No exposure detected → Continue good practices

## API Rate Limits

- **Email breach check**: Uses HIBP web interface (free, reasonable limits)
- **Pwned Passwords**: No authentication required, generous rate limits
- Be respectful with usage - add delays between multiple checks

## Security & Privacy

- Passwords never leave your machine in plaintext
- Uses k-anonymity model (industry standard)
- No data is stored or logged
- Open source - audit the code yourself

## Legal & Ethical Use

This tool is for:
- ✅ Checking your own accounts
- ✅ Security research with permission
- ✅ Helping others assess their security posture

NOT for:
- ❌ Unauthorized access attempts
- ❌ Credential stuffing
- ❌ Any malicious activity

## Example Output

```
🔍 BREACH ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

📧 Email: example@email.com

⚠️  This email appears in 3 breach(es):

  • LinkedIn
    Date: 2012-05-05
    Compromised data: Email addresses, Passwords

----------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Password has NOT been found in known breaches

----------------------------------------------------------------------
📊 RISK ASSESSMENT:
  🟡 MEDIUM RISK - Email breached but password appears safe
  💡 RECOMMENDATION: Change password if you still use it for this account
======================================================================
```
